# Judo Android SDK [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/judopay/maven/android-sdk/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/judopay/maven/android-sdk/_latestVersion)

The judo Android library lets you integrate secure in-app card payments into your Android app.

Use our UI components for a seamless user experience for card data capture. Minimise your [PCI scope](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/completing_self_assessment) with a UI that can be themed or customised to match the look and feel of your app.

##### Android Pay has launched in the UK. You can use this SDK to process Android Pay. For more information, please have a look at our [sample app](https://github.com/JudoPay/Judo-AndroidPay-Sample).

##### **\*\*\*Due to industry-wide security updates, versions below 5.0 of this SDK will no longer be supported after 1st Oct 2016. For more information regarding these updates, please read our blog [here](http://hub.judopay.com/pci31-security-updates/).*****

## Requirements
For the judo Android library to work correctly with your developer setup, please ensure the following requirements are met:

- Android Studio 2.0 or higher is installed
- Android SDK Build Tools 24.0.0 is installed
- The ```minSdkVersion``` for your app is set to 16 (Jelly Bean) or higher
- Android Support Repository and Android Support Library have the latest version installed.

## Getting started
##### 1. Integration
If using Android Studio and Gradle, add the Judopay Android SDK to your app's `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
compile 'com.judopay:android-sdk:5.5.1'
```

Ensure that you are using jCenter as a repository, this will be specified in the ```build.gradle``` file at the root of your project:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.1.2'
    }
}
```

##### 2. Setup
From your app's main Activity class, or Application class, initialize the judo SDK with your API token and secret:
```java
Judo judo = new Judo.Builder()
    .setApiToken("<API_TOKEN>")
    .setApiSecret("<API_SECRET>")
    .setEnvironment(Judo.SANDBOX)
    .setJudoId("100915867")
    .setAmount("1.00")
    .setCurrency(Currency.GBP)
    .setConsumerRef("<YOUR_REFERENCE>")
    .build();
```
##### 3. Make a payment
To show the payment screen, create an Intent for the `PaymentActivity` with the required Intent extras:
```java
Intent intent = new Intent(activity, PaymentActivity.class);
intent.putExtra(Judo.JUDO_OPTIONS, judo);

startActivityForResult(intent, PAYMENT_REQUEST);
```
**Note:** Please make sure that you are using a unique Consumer Reference for each different consumer.

##### 4. Check the payment result
In the Activity that calls the judo SDK, override the ```onActivityResult``` method to receive the payment receipt:
```java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    if(requestCode == PAYMENT_REQUEST) {
        switch (resultCode) {
            case Judo.RESULT_SUCCESS:
                Receipt receipt = data.getParcelableExtra(Judo.JUDO_RECEIPT);
                // handle successful payment
        }
    }
}
```
